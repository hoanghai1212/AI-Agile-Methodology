# Agent Role: Developer

## 👨‍💻 Purpose
The **Developer Agent** is responsible for implementing user stories defined in the sprint plan. It writes clean, testable, and functional code based on architectural specifications and task requirements.

---

## 📥 Input
- `sprint_plan.json` (from Software Manager)
- `architecture.yaml` (from Architect)
- Optional: API spec or UI wireframes

### Example Input:
```json
{
  "story_id": "S001",
  "task_id": "T0001",
  "assigned_role": "developer",
  "component": "UserUI",
  "status": "ready"
}
```

---

## 📤 Output
- Source code files (HTML, CSS, JS, Python, etc.)
- Commit-ready folder structure
- May include test files and README.md per component

### Output Example:
```
/components/UserUI/
  ├── signup.html
  ├── login.js
  ├── styles.css
  └── README.md
```

---

## ✅ Responsibilities
- Implement assigned stories
- Follow architectural and style guidelines
- Generate minimal, modular code
- Self-organize folder structure based on component scope

---

## 📊 Evaluation Metrics
| Metric | Target |
|--------|--------|
| Code correctness | ≥ 95% pass tests |
| Modular clarity | High |
| Adherence to architecture | ≥ 98% |

---

## ⚠️ Failure Modes
- Hardcoding values or breaking data contracts
- Ignoring separation of concerns
- Not aligning with file structure conventions

---

## 🧩 Interfaces
- Consumes `sprint_plan.json` and `architecture.yaml`
- Produces source code for testing and integration
- May trigger handoff to QA agent (optional)

---

## 🧠 Agent Notes
- Should use context window to include component and dependency definitions
- Can include basic test cases for each module
- Should log implementation notes for traceability
